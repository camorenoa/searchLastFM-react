		<h4 class="uppercase mt30">Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms</h4>
		<p>We and our  service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Site, App or Services. We or our service providers may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you.</p>
		<p><span class="emphasis">Do Not Track.</span> Our Site does not respond to Do Not Track signals. However, we do not track your activities once you leave our Site. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies).</p>
		<p><span class="emphasis">Cookies.</span> We or our service providers may use cookies to track visitor activity on our Site. A cookie is a text file that a website transfers to your computer’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. We or our service providers may use cookies to track user activities on our Site, such as the pages visited and time spent on our Site. Most browsers allow users to refuse cookies. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies may not be able to browse certain areas of the Site.</p>
		<p><span class="emphasis">Local Storage Objects.</span> We may use Flash Local Storage Objects ("Flash LSOs") to store your Site preferences and to personalize your visit. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot control, delete or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose "Global Storage Settings Panel" and follow the instructions. To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose "Website Storage Settings Panel" and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.</p>
		<p><span class="emphasis">Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.</span> Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content and compile statistics about Site usage. We or our service providers may also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed and track whether our emails are forwarded.</p>
		<p><span class="emphasis">Third-Party Analytics.</span> We or our service providers use automated devices and applications to evaluate use of our Site and App. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services. We or our service providers use these tools to help us improve our Site, App, Services, performance and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services.</p>
		<h4 class="uppercase mt30">User-Generated Content</h4>
		<p>We invite you to post content to our Service, including your comments, pictures, and any other information that you would like to be available on our Services. If you post content to our Services, all of the information that you post will be available to all visitors to our Services. If you post your own content on our Site, App or Services, your posting may become public and #Rise cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law or your personal privacy.</p>
		<h4 class="uppercase mt30">Third-Party Links</h4>
		<p>Our Services may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites.</p>
		<h4 class="uppercase mt30">Security of My Personal Information</h4>
		<p>We have implemented security measures to protect the personal information we collect. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, mobile device and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.</p>
		<h4 class="uppercase mt30">Access to My Personal Information</h4>
		<p>You may modify personal information that you have submitted by logging into your account and updating your profile information in your account settings on our Site or in our App. Please note that copies of information that you have updated, modified or deleted may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Site or App for a period of time.</p>
		<h4 class="uppercase mt30">Marketing Communications</h4>
		<p>We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to you. You may opt out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the email or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:Support@hashtagrise.com">Support@hashtagrise.com</a>.
