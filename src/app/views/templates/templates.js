It affects your rights.</h4><p>Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to a customer’s satisfaction by contacting us at <a href=mailto:support@hashtagrise.com>support@hashtagrise.com</a>. This Provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and Hashtag Rise. Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision. You have the right to opt-out of this Provision (as explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury.</p><p>Please read this Provision carefully. It provides that all Disputes between you and Hashtag Rise shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). Except as otherwise provided, entering into this agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees).</p><p>For the purpose of this Provision, \"Hashtag Rise\" means Hashtag Rise and its parents, subsidiary, and affiliate companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents. The term \"Dispute\" means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Hashtag Rise regarding any aspect of your relationship with Hashtag Rise, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below). \"Dispute\" is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as Hashtag Rise’s licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.</p><p class=uppercase>WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.</p><h4 class=\"underlined mt30\">Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</h4><p>For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give Hashtag Rise an opportunity to resolve the Dispute. You must commence this process by mailing written notification to Hashtag Rise, <a href=support@hashtagrise.com>support@hashtagrise.com</a>. That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your Claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek. If Hashtag Rise does not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration. You may pursue your Dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.</p><h4 class=\"underlined mt30\">Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out</h4><p>Notwithstanding the above, you or Hashtag Rise may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if (a) the Dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in small claims court; or (b) <span class=uppercase>YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT</span> (the \"Opt-Out Deadline\"). You may opt out of this Provision by mailing written notification to Hashtag Rise #RiseForLife, LLC, c/o Designers Views 1028 N. La Brea Ave, West Hollywood, CA 90038. Your written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Hashtag Rise through arbitration. Your decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with Hashtag Rise. Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your Dispute in arbitration or small claims court.</p><h4 class=\"underlined mt30\">Arbitration Procedures</h4><p>If this Provision applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or Hashtag Rise may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), <a href=\"http://www.adr.org/\">www.adr.org</a>, or JAMS, <a href=\"http://www.jamsadr.com/\">www.jamsadr.com</a>, will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Provision.</p><p>For arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. In either instance, the AAA’s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply. The AAA rules are available at <a href=\"http://www.adr.org/\">www.adr.org</a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879. For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply. The JAMS rules are available at <a href=\"http://www.jamsadr.com/\">www.jamsadr.com</a> or by calling 1-800-352-5267. This Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.</p><p>Because the Site and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\") governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.</p><p>Arbitration Award – The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.</p><p>Location of Arbitration – You or Hashtag Rise may initiate arbitration in Miami-Dade County, Florida or the federal judicial district that includes your billing address. In the event that you select the federal judicial district that includes your billing address, Hashtag Rise may transfer the arbitration to Miami-Dade County, Florida in the event that it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the transfer, as determined by the arbitrator.</p><p>Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs – Hashtag Rise will pay all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator’s costs and expenses upon your written request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration. You are responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses. Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law. In addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with Hashtag Rise as provided in the section above titled \"Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution\" and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.</p><h4 class=\"underlined mt30\">Class Action Waiver</h4><p>Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and Hashtag Rise specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration. <strong>If you choose to pursue your Dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you.</strong> Neither you, nor any other user of the Site can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.</p><h4 class=\"underlined mt30\">Jury Waiver</h4><p>You understand and agree that by entering into this Agreement you and Hashtag Rise are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court. In the absence of this Provision, you and Hashtag Rise might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions). Except as otherwise provided below, those rights are waived. Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited or may also be waived.</p><h4 class=\"underlined mt30\">Severability</h4><p>If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision, and the remainder of this Provision will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court.</p><h4 class=\"underlined mt30\">Continuation</h4><p>This Provision shall survive the termination of your service with Hashtag Rise or its affiliates. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Hashtag Rise makes any change to this Provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change and require Hashtag Rise to adhere to the language in this Provision if a dispute between us arises.</p><h4 class=\"uppercase mt30\">General.</h4><p>Hashtag Rise prefers to advise you if we feel you are not complying with these Terms and to recommend any necessary corrective action. However, certain violations of these Terms, as determined by Hashtag Rise, may result in immediate termination of your access to this Site without prior notice to you. The Federal Arbitration Act, Florida state law and applicable U.S. federal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions, will govern these Terms. Foreign laws do not apply. Except for Disputes subject to arbitration as described above, any disputes relating to these Terms or this Site will be heard in the courts located in . If any of these Terms is found to be inconsistent with applicable law, then such term shall be interpreted to reflect the intentions of the parties, and no other terms will be modified. Hashtag Rise’s failure to enforce any of these Terms is not a waiver of such term. These Terms are the entire agreement between you and Hashtag Rise and supersede all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements between you and Hashtag Rise about this Site. The proprietary rights, disclaimer of warranties, representations made by you, indemnities, limitations of liability and general provisions shall survive any termination of these Terms.</p><h4 class=\"uppercase mt30\">Contact Us.</h4><p>If you have any questions about these Terms or otherwise need to contact Hashtag Rise for any reason, you can reach us at <a href=mailto:support@hashtagrise.com>support@hashtagrise.com</a>.</p></div></div>");
